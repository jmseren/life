Conway's Game of Life in Processing


*This was written as an experiment in learning Processing, as well as to test how fast I could write Conway's Game of Life. In total it took about 1.5 hours, but I didn't time it concretely. This should not be used as an example of how to code in Processing.*


## Usage
**\*space\*** - *run or pause the simulation*

**\*right\*** - *advance the simulation one step*

**\*click\*** - *change a cells value*

**"n"** - **print the neighbor count of the cell under the cursor**
